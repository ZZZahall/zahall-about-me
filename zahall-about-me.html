  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <p>My decision to come to Epicodus was initiated last summer when I took a web
    design class and was introduced to my first web language html and css. I was
    suprised at how much I enjoyed the interactive learning process and was eager
    to continue this journey. Researching introduction to programming classes landed
    me at Epicodus. The intensive courses sounded intimidating and I was unfamiliar
    with pair programming but I had to take advantage of this opportunity that was being
    offered in my city.</p>
